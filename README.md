# Predictive Trading Strategies with Random Forest and LightGBM

## Overview

This project focuses on developing and testing predictive models using Random Forest Classifier and LightGBM to generate buy, sell, or hold signals for the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY). The models are trained on daily price data of stocks with the largest market capitalization, aiming to explore the potential of machine learning in enhancing trading strategies. 

## Key Features

- **Model Development**: Utilization of Random Forest Classifier and LightGBM for predictive modeling.
- **Signal Generation**: Production of buy, sell, or hold signals for SPY based on the predictive analysis.
- **Data Utilization**: Training models on daily price data of stocks with the highest market capitalization.
- **Back-Testing**: Rigorous back-testing against the traditional buy-and-hold strategy to validate performance.
- **Performance Analysis**: Demonstration of both models outperforming the buy-and-hold benchmark in the test set.

## Technologies Used

- **NumPy**: For efficient numerical computations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualization of data and back-testing results.
- **LightGBM**: For implementing the LightGBM model.
